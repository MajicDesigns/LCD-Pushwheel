## LCD-Pushwheel

Use the LCD module display to create a mechanical pushwheel/thumbwheel type display. When numbers change they are scrolled up or down as if on a cylinder.

Implemented for an LCD shield using the LiquidCrystal Library. Increment or decrement numbers using the UP/DOWN keys on the LCD shield.
